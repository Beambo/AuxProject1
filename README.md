**Documentation for Aux Project One(1)**

I started by creating a script which i would use in creation of my users for my project. This can be seen in the screenshot below

I then connected to my instance and copied the onboarding.sh file to my server for use.

I then followed this by creating a directory names *Shell* for the project where i moved the *onboarding.sh* file a nd then created the required csv file to contain the names of the users to be onboarded.

I then created the required public and private key needed to complete the project.

I then completed this by running the script to create all users at once.

I equally added a developer group for all the users

To access the server, i needed to add the private key for each individual on the local system to try and access and equally grant permission by protecting the key

After all the users had been created, i needed to confirm that all users were created appropriately and i can access the server with each one. So i tried logging in with 2 randomly as shown in the screenshot below
